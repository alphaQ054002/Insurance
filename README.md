## Welcome to the InsuraTranch project -- an EthIndia Fellowship initiative! 

This project is inspired by the research paper authored by Mathias Nadler, Felix Bekemeier, and Fabian Schar. You can find the original paper here.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to implement the concepts presented in the research paper using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. We've leveraged the code from the paper, specifically Insurance.sol, ITranche.sol, and Tranche.sol, which can be found in the contracts directory.
